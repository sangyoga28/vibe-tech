# Vibe Technologies - Brand Guidelines

> "Intelligence, Refined."

## 1. Core Identity
Vibe Technologies is not just an AI company; we are architects of the post-digital age. Our brand embodies **precision, fluidity, and depth**. We reject the clutter of the modern web in favor of a clean, immersive, and almost spiritual technological experience.

### Mission
To seamlessly integrate artificial super-intelligence with human creativity, removing the friction between thought and execution.

### Voice & Tone
*   **Visionary**: We speak about the future as if it is already here.
*   **Confident**: We do not use "maybe" or "try". We "enable," "transform," and "deliver."
*   **Minimalist**: We use fewer words to say more.
*   **Premium**: Avoid slang. Use elevated vocabulary (e.g., instead of "fast", use "zero-latency").

| **Void Black** | `#050507` | Primary Background. Deep, infinite, noise-textured. |
| **Electric Blue** | `#2997ff` | Primary Accent. Buttons, active states, innovative highlights. |
| **Neural Violet** | `#b666ff` | Secondary Accent. Gradients, 3D elements, "magic" moments. |

## 3. Logo Usage
*   **Text Logo**: "Vibe Tech" in Inter Bold, White.
*   **Icon**: The "V" symbol formed by two converging data streams (represented by the abstract shapes in our assets).
*   **Clear Space**: Always maintain 24px padding around the logo.

## 4. Product Naming

*   Never abbreviate to "VO" or "VF".
